# Beethoven Tutorial at ISCA 2025

> 📅 **Date:** June 2025
> 
> 📍 **Venue:** The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA 2025)

## Organizers

- Chris Kjellqvist (Duke University)
- Mansi Choudhary (Duke University)
- Mason Ma (Duke University)
- Lisa Wu Wills (Duke University)

## Description

SoC integration is a major source of complexity in hardware accelerator designs.
Beethoven is a full-stack development framework for developing and deploying device-agnostic hardware accelerators. Beethoven accomplishes this through separation of concerns, providing accelerator developers with device-agnostic programming abstractions for host-to-accelerator, accelerator-to-memory, and accelerator-to-accelerator communication, while also offering interfaces for tying device-specific implementations to Beethoven’s general-purpose fabric. This allows for one accelerator design to be portable across devices and for a single device integration to be reused across multiple accelerators, significantly simplifying the development and deployment process.
